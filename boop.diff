-# Compiler Compiler SpiderMonkey Playground
+# Compiler Compiler BUG [#1286997](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1286997)
+
+This bug playground covers stream [episodes 1-6](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLo3w8EB99pqJVPhmYbYdInBvAGarDavh-).
+
+The bug is captured by this test262 test: https://test262.report/browse/language/expressions/prefix-increment/S11.4.4_A6_T2.js
+
+The core problem is that in Spidermonkey, the expressions `obj[key]++` evaluates differently  than
+`obj[key]`. We can see this happen if we throw an error instead of key.
+
+First, build spidermonkey by [following these instructions](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/js/build.html).
+
+To run one of the tests for this, try this command in your console. `./mach jstest --shell js/src/build_DBG.OBJ/dist/bin/js
+postfix`.
+
+To see the solution for this, you can look through these patches:
+
+* [initial implementation](https://hg.mozilla.org/try/rev/37e07f6d9efb6c0e4c3fdb57f556797ed0a16f95)
+* [implementing compound assignment](https://hg.mozilla.org/try/rev/65b2659ee1ed8a1fb56981f455fa7e5e1bc4241c)
+* [implementing the bytecode in the interpreter](https://hg.mozilla.org/try/rev/afea27bde17d593b2e8d36d2ca9b96fd6bdd4e5a)
+* [implementing the bytecode in Baseline p1](https://hg.mozilla.org/try/rev/5a40802637bd056b31715599c45a19268b60ea0d)
+* [implementing the bytecode in Baseline p2 (corrections)](https://hg.mozilla.org/try/rev/3670e05fb48261683a671d46160cb54f1529e02c)
+* [implementing the bytecode in Ion](https://hg.mozilla.org/try/rev/d00744e7819961c5e6c964eb09b3977532cbe958)

 you learned, by replicating bugs that are covered in the stream.
 
-What this repository is -> A complete copy of the Firefox codebase, including Spidermonkey. For our purposes, we are mostly interested in the `js` directory. Why the whole browser? It is a long story but basically it is difficult to completely separate Spidermonkey from Gecko and other Firefox components.

+This repository is organized around branches. Each branch enables a test that will fail when you try to run it. Information about the bug will be found in the
 README.md of that branch, so you will always know what you need to do, along with what kind of challenges you can expect on the way.
 
 Once you finish a bug, you can open a pull request and have it marked. It won't be merged, it will just be marked as correct. If you have any issues or questions, please open an issue and I will try to answer. Also
